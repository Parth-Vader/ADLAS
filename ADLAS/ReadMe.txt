"BegSetCreate.cpp" gets input from "prev.csv" and "now.csv" and the finds the apps that were opened just now. It saves these apps in "BegSetNow.txt"
Then "check.cpp" gets these files and checks them against "clusters.txt" to get te files that are to be opened. It saves these apps in "filestorun.csv"
"RunApps.cpp" takes "filestorun.csv", converts it word by word(app by app) to "word.txt" and using "RunApp.py" runs the apps.
